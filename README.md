# libfido2

A WIP Rust wrapper for [libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2).

I currently do not own a Yubikey 5, only a Yubikey Security Key. Therefore I am unable to test some functionality.

Contributions welcome!

## Current progress

- [x] Device detection
- [x] Device creation
- [x] Device CBOR information
- [ ] Device setting management
- [ ] Credential management
- [ ] FIDO2 assertions
